What happens when you initilize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git creates a directory when all the necesary metadata is ready so I can start to track my files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allow me to control the files in my repository, and decide what to commit, this is giving me more control.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Because I can see my last changes on my working directoryand the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
I think this is when Git starts to be more powerful, This is what version control systems are about, it`s like having more than two or three different files.
