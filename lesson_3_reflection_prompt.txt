When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I'm working with someone else on my project, or I want to make it public.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because in some cases I want to keep priveate my repository, and if I'm working with someone else maybe I don't want her/him to see the change until all is ready.
